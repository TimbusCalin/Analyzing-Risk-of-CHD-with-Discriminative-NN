# Analyzing-Risk-of-CHD-with-Discriminative-NN
This project is part of a research paper that was presented as a poster at ICPRAM 2020. It highlights the use of discriminative neural networks to tackle the problem of class imbalance. Find the paper here: https://www.insticc.org/Primoris/Resources/PaperPdf.ashx?idPaper=91901

## About
The reporitory contains different Jupyter notebooks to highlight the change in parameters liek accuracy and loss when different techniques are used on the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Framingham Heart Study data with a high class imbalance between positive nd negative samples. It has a total of 4240 samples.

## Data Preparation
The data has many missing values which were imputed suitably based on data type. Also, the data underwent a thorough preprocessing before being fed into the network.

## Results
The discriminative model built using a Siamese network outperforms the base vanilla NN considerably
